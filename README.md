# Introduction
This is a collection of R codes written for specific tasks or capstone projects and organized as one task or project per folder. 
Usually there will be a .html as a final knit from a successfully excuted R markdone document.
Therefore there should also be a R markdone file along with it. But sometimes I forget about uploading it. 
Html should do the job anyway. 

Package "tidyverse" is almost always used. Task unique packages will be listed in the keywords.
