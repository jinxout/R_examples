# Introduction
This is a collection of R codes written for specific tasks or capstone projects and organized as one task or project per folder.  
Usually there will be a .html and a R markdone file along with it. But sometimes I forget one of them.  

Package "tidyverse" is almost always used. Task unique packages will be listed in the keywords.  
Good luck!
